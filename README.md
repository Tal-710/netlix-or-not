This project utilizes various Python libraries, including Selenium, BeautifulSoup, requests, and pandas, to scrape data from websites, perform data analysis, and implement machine learning algorithms. Additionally, use of scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, to train and evaluate our predictive models for determining the availability of TV shows on Netflix. These libraries provide powerful tools and functionality to support our data-driven approach and enhance the accuracy of our predictions.
